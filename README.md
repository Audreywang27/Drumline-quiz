This is my Drumline Quiz!

As a member of a drumline, I try my best to sort you into your section! (I don't have pit (unfortunately) my school doesn't have a pit, so I feel like I won't be the most accurate...lolz)
There are four drumline sections: tenor, bass, snare, and cymbals. Based on my experiences with each of these sections, I tried to create a quiz that would accurately sort test takers into the four!

I made this project because I was inspired by an online quiz I took...it was a "what eeveelution are you?" type of quiz, and the creator made it using code! Very cool. This is the link, highly recommend you check it out!: https://maxx1128.github.io/Which-Eeveelution-Are-You/

I made this project on VS Code. Unlike my first html based project, I tried to add a depth of organization?? It kinda worked?? I definitely learned some new things that I need to do for my next one...the organizational strategy I tried in this one was still a bit too messy. 

Something I struggled with was the formatting of the website...oh my goodness. I also learned that I am very indecisive with the color scheme. This quiz was originally a banana yellow, and it was changed multiple times before I finally gave up and was like "we're going grayscale". So for my text project, I definitely want to work on choosing/designing a better theme?? I think this one is kinda boring, but I really didn't wanna go through the work of reformatting my webpage again ;-;
