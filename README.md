This is my Drumline Quiz!

As a member of a drumline, I try my best to sort you into your section! (I don't have pit (unfortunately) my school doesn't have a pit, so I feel like I won't be the most accurate...lolz)
There are four drumline sections: tenor, bass, snare, and cymbals. Based on my experiences with each of these sections, I tried to create a quiz that would accurately sort test takers into the four!
